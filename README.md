This project involves filling in missing probabilities in a Bayesian Network used for medical diagnosis. The network maps connections between diseases and symptoms. We use patient data to learn these probabilities. Input includes the network structure and patient records, outputting a complete network with filled probabilities. Collaboration is allowed within class guidelines, but plagiarism is strictly prohibited. The accuracy of learned values determines the project's success.
